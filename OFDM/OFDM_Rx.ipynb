    "## OFDM Signal Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete **baseband receiver-side analysis** of an OFDM signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synchronization via energy threshold and correlation\n",
    "* CP detection to validate symbol structure\n",
    "* FFT demodulation for symbol extraction\n",
    "* Visualization of constellation and power spectrum\n",
    "* Subcarrier diagnostics for quality inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is valuable for evaluating **modulation integrity**, **timing accuracy**, and **subcarrier behavior** in both simulated and real-world OFDM systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Signal Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the received signal (input data)\n",
    "* Define OFDM parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Estimated symbol length\n",
    "  * Estimated cyclic prefix\n",
    "  * Total symbol length\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Autocorrelation for Rough Symbol Start**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute autocorrelation of the received signal to identify repeating structure.\n",
    "* Detect the **initial start index** of OFDM symbols based on energy thresholding.\n",
    "* Use a moving window to refine this estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Cyclic Prefix (CP) Correlation-Based Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sweep over candidate start indices around the rough estimate.\n",
    "* For each, check the correlation between CP and end of symbols.\n",
    "* Select the start index that gives the **maximum average CP correlation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Downsampling and Multiple Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optionally test different values of symbol scaling or downsampling factor\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze resolution and robustness across symbol lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Symbol Extraction and FFT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the chosen start index, extract all OFDM symbols.\n",
    "* Remove the cyclic prefix from each.\n",
    "* Perform FFT on each symbol to transform to the frequency domain.\n",
    "* Apply `fftshift` to center the DC subcarrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Constellation Plotting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flatten all subcarriers from all symbols into a single array.\n",
    "* Plot real vs. imaginary values of subcarriers to visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Identify modulation type (e.g., QPSK, QAM)\n",
    "  * Analyze signal quality and distortions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Subcarrier Power Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate power per subcarrier for each symbol.\n",
    "* Identify **low-power (null or attenuated)** subcarriers.\n",
    "* Use `stem` plots to highlight which subcarriers fall below a threshold (e.g., power < threshold).\n",
    "* Overplot known null subcarriers for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Focused Subcarrier Constellation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract only the **useful subcarriers**\n",
    "* Discard DC or null subcarriers\n",
    "* Flatten and visualize constellation from these active carriers.\n",
